    <p>Daemap is a project that involves the development of an application able to tracking AEDs (Automated External
      Defibrillators) within the urban area perimeter. The project addresses the significant issue of cardiac arrest,
      which leads to hundreds of deaths each year. For the design of this application, a study was conducted, starting
      with interviews, competitor analysis, target definition, and ending with the testing of the application itself.

    <p>Part of the project also includes the identity aspect: this part is dedicated to designing the logo. The logo
      aims to depict a crossroads within a map alongside the symbol of the AED. Below there is the construction grid.
      The chosen colors evoke a medical context.
      The application contains several sections because it serves a dual purpose: to facilitate rescue during
      emergencies and also to raise awareness and provide information on the topic. Within the application, there is not
      only an illustrated guide on first aid maneuvers but also a small quiz aimed at engaging users through play.
      Among the various sections, users can add a new AED if it isn’t in the map, measure their heart rate in case of
      emergency, and contact emergency services (112) directly from the application.</p>
